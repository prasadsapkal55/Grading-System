# Student Grading System

A simple command-line **Student Grading System** written in Python.  
It lets an **admin** log in and then:
- **Enter a student’s grades**
- **Remove a student**
- **Calculate/view average grades** (per student and overall)

The project uses **functions**, **lists**, and **dictionaries** to store data and keep the code modular and easy to extend.
